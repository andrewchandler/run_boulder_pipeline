								<h3>Personal Information</h3>
After a successful college career where I won 5 NCAA titles, I became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Butler" target="_blank"><b>professional athlete</b>.</a> I competed in 2 Olympics, Atlanta in 1996 and Athens in 2004. I competed in 21 World Championships in track, cross country and road, including 5 top 20 finishes at the world cross country and a team bronze medal.
								<!--						<p>I was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and moved to England then Canada at eleven and again to the United States for University. As a result I have two citizenships (British and Canadian) and a green card to live and work in the US. --> <br></br>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1997 with a degree in Exercise Physiology and Biology (Dean's list and Academic All-American). I was also a volunteer assistant coach at both the University of Wisconsin and Stanford University. <!--I enjoyed working with the cross country and track teams at both universities and it was a great compliment to my own running career.-->


								<!-- <p>In 2005 I moved to Nederland, Colorado to live in the mountains and train at altitude. It is a great place to live and train and has a nice running community that is both a part of and separate from the better known Boulder just down the hill. <br></br>When I was coaching the high school track and cross country teams in Nederland it allowed me to get more involved with the community and continue working on my coaching skills. We won 12 state individual and team championships.<br></br>In 1994 I was diagnosed with Graves' disease which is an autoimmune disease that kept me out of running for a couple of months but is in remission now.<br></br>I have now transitioned completely from professional athlete to coach and love the rewards and challenges of coaching.<br></br>I also teach coaching education for USATF. This allows me to share my passion for coaching while meeting coaches from all over the United States. --><br></br>I am a USATF Level 3 certified coach and USATF Coaching Education instructor, bringing a wealth of knowledge to coaching every athlete I coach whether it's a first time marathoner or my elite athletes competing at Major Championships. </p> In December, 2017 I was awarded the "<b>Level 2 Coaches Rising Star Award</b>" from <a href="http://www.usatf.org/Resources-for---/Coaches/Coaching-Education/CE-Awards.aspx" target="_blank"><b>USATF, USA Track & Field</b>.</a>
